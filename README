***** OVERVIEW ****
* Classes about polynomial, rational polynomial, hyper real(non-standard analyses). 
* This package is distributed freely in the sense of GNU General Public License(GPL).
  See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html .
* Polynomial-like classes:
    Polynomial: 1-variable polynomial
    PolynomialM: multi-variable polynomial
    RationalPoly: 1-variable rational polynomial
    RationalPolyM: multi-variable rational polynomial
* Coefficients:
  Coefficients are Integer or Float by default. And Z/pZ (p:prime).
  We can use Rational or Complex with require "rational" or require "complex". 
  Other field or ring is admitted if you define. 
* Grobner bases:
  For multi variable polynomials, it supports coefficients of
  Integer, Z/pZ (p:prime), Rational, Float and Complex.
  For 1-variable polynomials, it supports Integer coefficient and
  Integer coefficients Laurent polynomials.
* Factorization:
  It support factorization for 1-variable Integer and Rational coefficient.
* Hyper-Real (non-standard analyses) class:
  HyperReal class supports non-standard analyses.
  It supports infinity, infinitesimal, limit, derivatives, auto-diff.
* Extensions for Math functions:
  MathExt module supports many functions for
  HyperReal, Rational, Polynomial, RationalPoly, etc.
* Number theory:
  Number module contains some function on number theory and algebra.
* Samples:
  See samples scripts sample-*.rb.
